# Office Online Server release schedule

 **Summary:** Learn about the Office Online Server release schedule and upgrade requirements.
  
    
    


Microsoft plans to release new builds of Office Online Server twice each year, with each new build supported for approximately six months from its general availability (GA) release date. Each new build will be supported with security and critical updates until the next build is released.
  
    
    


Previous builds will continue to function. However, if you request support that ultimately requires a hotfix, you will be required to upgrade to the latest build.
  
    
    


The following table shows the Office Online Server build release history and current build.
  
    
    


(You can determine your current build by looking at the **Version** number in Add/Remove Programs.)
