# Configure server-to-server authentication between Office Online Server and SharePoint Server 2016

 **Summary:** Configure server-to-server authentication between Office Online Server and SharePoint 2016.

Server-to-server authentication between Office Online Server and SharePoint Server 2016 establishes trust between the two servers. This trust is a necessary prerequisite for some Excel Online features, such as Office Data Connection (ODC) file support and the IT Management Dashboard, which is part of SQL Server Power Pivot for SharePoint. This article guides you through the steps to set up this trust.

To configure server-to-server authentication, your Office Online Server farm and SharePoint Server farm must be in the same Active Directory forest. You also must have a User Profile service application configured on the SharePoint Server farm.

The basic actions required for configuring server-to-server authentication are:

1.  [Import the certificate to Office Online Server](configure-server-to-server-authentication-between-office-online-server-and-share.md#ImportCerts)
2.  [Export the certificate for use on SharePoint Server](configure-server-to-server-authentication-between-office-online-server-and-share.md#ExportCerts)
3.  [Configure Office Online Server to use the certificate for server-to-server authentication](configure-server-to-server-authentication-between-office-online-server-and-share.md#ConfigureWAC)
4.  [Configure SharePoint Server to use the certificate for server-to-server authentication](configure-server-to-server-authentication-between-office-online-server-and-share.md#ConfigureSharePoint)

You'll start with importing the certificate to Office Online Server.

## Import the certificate to Office Online Server
<a name="ImportCerts"> </a>

The first step is to import your certificate for use by Office Online Server. Follow the  *Import your certificate*  and *Grant network service permission to use the key*  procedures on each server in your Office Online Server farm.

### Import your certificate

You can use either a private key SSL certificate or a self-signed certificate. We highly recommend using a private key SSL certificate. The following sections provide procedures for both. Choose the one the you are using.

#### Use a private key SSL certificate

Install the certificate on each server running Office Online Server.

### To install the certificate on Office Online Server

1. On the server running Office Online Server, open IIS Manager.
2. In the left pane, click the server name.
3. Double-click **Server Certificates**.
4. In the **Actions** pane, click **Import**.
5. Type the  *path*  and *file name*  of the SSL certificate that you want to use.
6. In the **Password** box, type the *password*  for the certificate.
7. In the **Select Certificate Store** drop-down list, make sure **Personal** is selected.
8. Click **OK**.

Repeat this procedure on each server running Office Online.

#### Use a self-signed certificate

If you're using a self-signed certificate, you need to add it to the Trusted Root Certification Authorities.

### To import the certificate to the Trusted Root Certification Authorities

1. Open the Microsoft Management Console.
2. On the **File** menu, choose **Add/Remove Snap-in**.
3. Choose **Certificates**, and then click **Add**.
4. Choose the **Computer account** option, click **Next**, and then click **Finish**.
5. Click **OK**.
6. Expand **Certificates (Local Computer)**, right-click **Trusted Root Certification Authorities**, click **All Tasks**, and then click **Import**.
7. Click **Next**.
8. Browse to the location of the certificate, select it, and then click **Next**.
9. Type the certificate password, click **Next**, and then click **Finish**.

Keep the Microsoft Management Console open for the next procedure.

### Grant network service permission to use the key

Next, use the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) to grant the network service permissions to use the private key.

### To grant network service permissions to use the private key

1. Open the Microsoft Management Console.
2. On the **File** menu, choose **Add/Remove Snap-in**.
3. Choose **Certificates**, and then click **Add**.
4. Choose the **Computer account** option, click **Next**, and then click **Finish**.
5. Click **OK**.
6. Expand **Certificates (Local Computer)**, expand **Personal**, and then click **Certificates**.
7. Right-click the certificate that you just imported, click **All Tasks**, and then click **Manage Private Keys**.
8. In the **Permissions** dialog box, click **Add**.
9. Type Network Service, and then click **OK**.
10. Click **OK**.

Be sure you follow the  *Import your certificate*  and *Grant network service permission to use the key*  procedures on each server in your Office Online Server farm.

Keep the Microsoft Management Console open for the next procedure. 

## Export the certificate for use on SharePoint Server
<a name="ExportCerts"> </a>

The next step is to export the certificate so that you can use it to register Office Online Server as a trusted token issuer.

### To export the certificate for use with SharePoint Server 2016

1. Right-click the certificate that you just imported, click **All Tasks**, and then click **Export**.
2. On the Welcome page, click **Next**.
3. Choose the **No, do not export the private key** option, and then click **Next**.
4. Choose the **DER encoded binary X.509 (.CER)** option, and then click **Next**.
5. Type the  *path*  and *name*  of the file that you want to export, and then click **Next**.
6. Click **Finish**, and then click **OK**.

Copy the certificate file that you created to a location where you can access it from SharePoint Server.

Next, you need to specify this certificate as the S2S certificate for Office Online Server.

<a name="ConfigureWAC"> </a>

### To specify the S2S certificate for Office Online Server

1. Open a Microsoft PowerShell window as Administrator.
2. Type the following where \<friendlyName> is the friendly name of the certificate that you're using.
    
```
Set-OfficeWebAppsFarm -S2SCertificateName "<friendlyName>" -Confirm:$false -Force
```

 **Using HTTP with Office Online Server**
    
If you're using HTTP instead of HTTPS for your Office Online Server farm, you have to allow outbound HTTP connections from Office Online Server. (If you're using SSL, you can skip this procedure.)

To enable outbound HTTP connections from Office Online Server, run the following PowerShell command:

```
Set-OfficeWebAppsFarm -AllowOutboundHttp:$True
iisreset
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is strongly recommended to use HTTPS (TLS) regardless of environment as Office Online Server uses OAuth tokens to communicate with external services, such as SharePoint or Exchange Server. OAuth tokens contain information that can potentially be intercepted and replayed by an attacker, granting the attacker the same rights as the user making the request to Office Online Server.

 **Using HTTP paths with ODC files**

If you plan to store ODC files in an HTTP path, you have to configure Office Online Server to allow Secure Store connections over HTTP.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you use Secure Store connections over HTTP, the contents of the ODC file are passed in clear text. ODC files contain database connection information and can contain passwords. Microsoft recomments using HTTPS.

To enable Office Online Server to use HTTP paths with Secure Store, run the following PowerShell command:

```
Set-OfficeWebAppsFarm -AllowHttpSecureStoreConnections:$true
iisreset
```

## Configure SharePoint Server to use the certificate for server-to-server authentication
<a name="ConfigureSharePoint"> </a>

You need to register SharePoint Server and SQL Server as trusted token issuers. This is done through PowerShell. Here are the parameters that you'll use:

- **\<SPSiteURL>** - The URL of your top-level site collection.
- **\<CertificateIssuer>** - The name of the certificate issuer. You can find this by viewing the **Details** tab of the certificate in IIS Manager.
- **\<X509Certificate>** - The path and file name of the certificate file that you exported.
- **\<RegisteredIssuer>** - The GUID of the trusted token issuer. SharePoint Server is 67e3df25-268a-4324-a550-0de1c7f97287@bd2372e4-0a11-495c-9541-8377c6def195 and SQL Server is 67e3df25-268a-4324-a550-0de1c7f97287@ffab2d74-c6ae-4375-819a-8555d49b699a

Perform the following procedure twice - once for each \<RegisteredIssuer> GUID.

### To register a trusted token issuer

1. Open the SharePoint 2016 Management Shell as Administrator.
2. Run the following script using the parameters noted above:
    
  ```
  $issuer = New-SPTrustedSecurityTokenIssuer -Name <CertificateIssuer> -Certificate <X509Certificate> -RegisteredIssuerName <RegisteredIssuer>
  $app = Get-SPAppPrincipal -Site <SPSiteURL> -NameIdentifier $issuer.NameId
  $site = Get-SPSite <SPSiteURL>
  Set-SPAppPrincipalPermission -appPrincipal $app -Site $site.RootWeb -Scope SiteSubscription -Right FullControl -EnableAppOnlyPolicy
  ```

3. If you're using a self-signed certificate, run the following command:
    
  ```
  New-SPTrustedRootAuthority -Name <CertificateIssuer> -Certificate <X509Certificate>
  ```
