<td><p>Installation</p></td>
<td><p>Office Web Apps is not installed on the same servers that run SharePoint 2013. Instead, you deploy one or more physical or virtual servers that run Office Web Apps Server. Then you configure the SharePoint 2013 farm to use the Office Web Apps Server farm to provide Office Web Apps functionality to users who create or open Office files from SharePoint libraries. For more information, see <a href="office-web-apps-server-overview.md">Office Web Apps Server overview</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Licensing</p></td>
<td><p>SharePoint 2013 provides new license enforcement that works with Office Web Apps. If you enable SharePoint licensing and then enable Office Web Apps editing, only the users who have the appropriate license can actually edit Office files in a browser. If no Office Web Apps editing licenses are applied for users, only viewing is supported. For more information about how licensing works in SharePoint 2013, see <a href="/sharepoint/administration/administration">Configure licensing in SharePoint Server 2013</a>.</p></td>
